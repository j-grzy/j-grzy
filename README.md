### Hi there 👋
___
#### I'm a UX/UI Designer and Front-End Developer based in Leipzig.

📚 I am currently completing a Full Stack Web Development course at DCI, sharpening my front-end skills and diving into back-end technologies.

💜 I'm focused on creating accessible designs and developing an inclusive web for everyone.

💡 Always looking for new challenges, I learn something new every day!

🐤 And I like birds.

Feel free to check out my projects!
